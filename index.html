    <p>I am a rising senior at Lawrence North High School. Prior to Nextech I have had only one year of coding. I hope to study electrical engineering in college and get a job that has something to do with electrics and technology after I graduate college. My hobbies include playing video games, watching TV, and reading comics.Some of my favorite video games are god of War, Marvle's Spider-man, and Batman: Arkham Knight. Some other hobbies I have are I love to play golf and go camping with my father and uncle. </p>
